- Setup organization table and associate users with organization.
- Define more clear user roles based on organization

- Identify Input components for the application forms for client based on Figma design systems
- Each Input will have its own file and will recieve prompt, current user answer, and settings as props.
- Settings will be defined as interfaces for every type of input (each input type will have a different kind of settings)
- BASICALLY: Just implement whatever you see in Figma design systems for Inputs in different conditions (default, answered, active, error, with helper text, etc.)
